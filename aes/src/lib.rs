//! Pure Rust implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard
//! (a.k.a. Rijndael)
//!
//! # Supported backends
//! This crate provides multiple backends including a portable pure Rust
//! backend as well as ones based on CPU intrinsics.
//!
//! By default, it performs runtime detection of CPU intrinsics and uses them
//! if they are available.
//!
//! ## "soft" portable backend
//! As a baseline implementation, this crate provides a constant-time pure Rust
//! implementation based on [fixslicing], a more advanced form of bitslicing
//! implemented entirely in terms of bitwise arithmetic with no use of any
//! lookup tables or data-dependent branches.
//!
//! Enabling the `compact` Cargo feature will reduce the code size of this
//! backend at the cost of decreased performance (using a modified form of
//! the fixslicing technique called "semi-fixslicing").
//!
//! ## ARMv8 intrinsics (nightly-only)
//! On `aarch64` targets including `aarch64-apple-darwin` (Apple M1) and Linux
//! targets such as `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` and `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`,
//! support for using AES intrinsics provided by the ARMv8 Cryptography Extensions
//! is available when using the nightly compiler, and can be enabled using the
//! `armv8` crate feature.
//!
//! On Linux and macOS, when the `armv8` feature is enabled support for AES
//! intrinsics is autodetected at runtime. On other platforms the `aes`
//! target feature must be enabled via RUSTFLAGS.
//!
//! ## `x86`/`x86_64` intrinsics (AES-NI)
//! By default this crate uses runtime detection on `i686`/`x86_64` targets
//! in order to determine if AES-NI is available, and if it is not, it will
//! fallback to using a constant-time software implementation.
//!
//! Passing `RUSTFLAGS=-Ctarget-feature=+aes,+ssse3` explicitly at compile-time
//! will override runtime detection and ensure that AES-NI is always used.
//! Programs built in this manner will crash with an illegal instruction on
//! CPUs which do not have AES-NI enabled.
//!
//! Note: runtime detection is not possible on SGX targets. Please use the
//! afforementioned `RUSTFLAGS` to leverage AES-NI on these targets.
//!
//! # Usage example
//! ```
//! use aes::{Aes128, Block};
//! use aes::cipher::{
//!     BlockCipher, BlockEncrypt, BlockDecrypt, KeyInit,
//!     generic_array::GenericArray,
//! };
//!
//! let key = GenericArray::from_slice(&[0u8; 16]);
//! let mut block = Block::clone_from_slice(&[42u8; 16]);
//!
//! // Initialize cipher
//! let cipher = Aes128::new(&key);
//!
//! let block_copy = block.clone();
//!
//! // Encrypt block in-place
//! cipher.encrypt_block(&mut block);
//!
//! // And decrypt it back
//! cipher.decrypt_block(&mut block);
//! assert_eq!(block, block_copy);
//!
//! // implementation supports parrallel block processing
//! // number of blocks processed in parallel depends in general
//! // on hardware capabilities
//! let mut blocks = [block; 100];
//! cipher.encrypt_blocks(
//!     &mut blocks,
//!     |chunk| {
//!         // you can process encrypted chunk here, e.g. for MAC
//!     },
//! );
//!
//! for block in blocks.iter_mut() {
//!     cipher.decrypt_block(block);
//!     assert_eq!(block, &block_copy);
//! }
//!
//! cipher.decrypt_blocks(
//!     &mut blocks,
//!     |chunk| {
//!         // you can process decrypted chunk here
//!     },
//! );
//!
//! for block in blocks.iter_mut() {
//!     cipher.encrypt_block(block);
//!     assert_eq!(block, &block_copy);
//! }
//! ```

//! [`block-modes`] crate.
